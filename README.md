## üß† Project Overview

This project enables a robot in the **Robosuite** simulation environment to be controlled entirely through **natural language commands**. The robot's task is to move a cube from point A to point B based on short, user-issued text instructions. These commands can be **imperative** (e.g., "move left") or **declarative** (e.g., "grab the cube"), and are parsed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Our main objective was to build a robust NLP-to-action pipeline where the robot can understand different phrasings for the same command, such as "go left" and "move left," and execute them reliably using a PID controller.

## üß™ Project Goals and Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Interpret and map a variety of natural language commands to predefined robotic actions.
- ‚úÖ Move a cube from a start location to a target location **using only text input**.
- ‚úÖ Ensure **90%+ success rate** on complete tasks without manual intervention.
- ‚úÖ Handle unknown or malformed commands gracefully (error handling).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

- **Robosuite**: Used as the simulation environment for robotic manipulation.
- **PID Controller**: Guides the robot‚Äôs motion to perform low-level control actions.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Converts user input into actionable commands using:
  - `SpaCy` / `NLTK` / `HuggingFace Transformers` for intent recognition
  - Command mapping strategies (intent normalization, synonyms, etc.)
- **Policy Engine**: Maps high-level intents to specific sequences of PID-controlled actions.
