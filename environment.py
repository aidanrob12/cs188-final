TEAM PLEASE READ THIS:
So basically, if you try to do like let's say lift green cube while you have a red one in your hand, it'll just reset the whole thing and do the other policy
or crash (idk what is the reason for this). To avoid this I hard coded a prev_policy so that if it's one of the ones that will crash the program you will
not be able to run it
